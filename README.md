## Ways to help

Many of the packs are missing methadata on github. A pack shuld have the large pack icon, a description, and the pack itself.\
See `datapacks\No More Ruined Portals` for example.

It have been brught to my attention that you can do multi version support. Some packs have multiple versions on modrinth that shuld be merged using this feature.
